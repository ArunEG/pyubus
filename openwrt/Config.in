	  PyUbus provides a comprehensive Python interface for interacting with 
	  OpenWrt's ubus (micro bus architecture) via HTTP/JSON-RPC.
	  
	  This package replaces the need for subprocess calls to the ubus 
	  command-line tool with a clean, Pythonic API that supports:
	  
	  * Session management and authentication
	  * Comprehensive error handling with specific exception types
	  * Context manager support for resource management
	  * Command-line interface similar to native ubus
	  * Type hints for better IDE integration
	  
	  The package includes:
	  - Python library (pyubus)
	  - Command-line tool (pyubus)
	  - Configuration via UCI (/etc/config/pyubus)
	  - Init script for service management
	  
	  Useful for automation scripts, monitoring tools, and custom 
	  management interfaces that need to interact with OpenWrt's 
	  system services.
	  
	  Size: ~50KB + dependencies (~2-5MB)
